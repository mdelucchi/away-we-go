// Command returns the Cmd struct to execute the named program with the given arguments.
// sets only the Path and Args in the returned structure.
// If name contains no path separators, Command uses LookPath to resolve name to a complete path if possible.
// Otherwise it uses name directly as Path.

// The returned Cmd's Args field is constructed from the command name followed by the elements of arg, so arg should not include the command name itself. For example, Command("echo", "hello"). Args[0] is always name, not the possibly resolved Path.
